### Creation of the index .visthreed

To save visualizations you must have created the index **.visthreed**, this is the mapping of the index (__Recommended use Sense or CURL to create it__):

```
PUT .visthreed
{
    "settings" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 1
    },
    "mappings" : {
        "items" : {
            "properties" : {
                "chartType" : { "type" : "text" },
                "name" : { "type" : "text" },
                "description" : { "type" : "text" },
                "metricsSelected" : { "type": "object" },
                "bucketsSelected" : { "type": "object" },
                "visobject" : { "type": "object" }
            }
        }
